# Svelte TypeScript Codespace 

## Why I use and recommend this?

### Svelte - My story
I came from AI/ML background - trying to build an user facing product.

As conventional wisdom goes, I started with React and Next.js. But found that the programming model was not obvious to me. And the availability of templates actually made it harder - I am able to get a template working very fast, but struggle even to make a small change. I did try some other frameworks, but found the same problem.

Then I found Svelte. It was a click right the way, I love the fact that I can write plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript(TS) the way I normally do with a normal programming model. I just go through the tutorial 1 time and the rest I spend on reading the Moliza web docs which appear to me as the right way to do things.  


### TypeScript - CodeSpace and the modern development evnironment
Programming as a tool to solve problems, and create value. 

I still remmeber the days when I was writing C and python for my thesis, it is just a pain to fix syntax errors everyday and debug with print. And the inexperience make me think that is the real skill of programming. 

No. Programming is not about fixing bugs and laboring through indiosyncratic mistakes. 

Programming is also not about setting up the environment, and the tooling. Let grow up and let the computer do the work for us. Dont put junior developers on the battle field without proper armor, that just negligent and cruel.
